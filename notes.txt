What if i make two  mains one for checker and one for push_swap
and for each program, only the right main is compiled.

*** CHANGE LIBFT FOR MY OWN****

-1 leak. I am losing a pointer somewhere
-when doing pa with full pb (and ampty pa) there is a mix up
-everytime I do a command I get a extra leak and there is one before the commands start
- can't enter 0 as number or integer in checkers
-good makefile


VOOR NU:
-make function for 3 numbers
-have mpv function
-check last_check in beginning, then the aca. 
-if aca is bigger ten 5 go to mpv

1-after mpv, go trough whole list in 2 threads from bottom and top to 
find numbers lower then mpv, they go the stack b. 
1-while they go to stack b, (its the n (aca /2) amount of numbers) that move
to stack b and they get a id tack. The first time it's 1. In the id tack they also store there amount n.
1-if stack a is still not 3. (first time it's to check n), it goes again to mpv
and n changes to n/2. step 2 will be repeated. Only now the id tack is 2.
